# Differentiation between autism spectrum disorder and attention‑deficit/hyperactivity disorder

## A data driven machine learning approach to differentiate between autism spectrum disorder and attention‑deficit/hyperactivity disorder based on the best‑practice diagnostic instruments for autism
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention‑deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are two 
frequently co‑occurring neurodevelopmental conditions that share certain symptomatology, including 
social difficulties. This presents practitioners with challenging (differential) diagnostic considerations, 
particularly in clinically more complex cases with co‑occurring ASD and ADHD. Therefore, the 
primary aim of the current study was to apply a data‑driven machine learning approach (support 
vector machine) to determine whether and which items from the best‑practice clinical instruments 
for diagnosing ASD (ADOS, ADI‑R) would best differentiate between four groups of individuals 
referred to specialized ASD clinics (i.e., ASD, ADHD, ASD + ADHD, ND = no diagnosis). We found 
that a subset of five features from both ADOS (clinical observation) and ADI‑R (parental interview) 
reliably differentiated between ASD groups (ASD & ASD + ADHD) and non‑ASD groups (ADHD & ND), 
and these features corresponded to the social‑communication but also restrictive and repetitive 
behavior domains. In conclusion, the results of the current study support the idea that detecting 
ASD in individuals with suspected signs of the diagnosis, including those with co‑occurring ADHD, is 
possible with considerably fewer items relative to the original ADOS/2 and ADI‑R algorithms (i.e., 92% 
item reduction) while preserving relatively high diagnostic accuracy. Clinical implications and study 
limitations are discussed.
